					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I initally had problems with making my code work. As the task is essentialy to create a button that will produce a new line everytime, 
                        some of my code at first wasn't working. Then I realized I didn't input the code that would generate new text, meaning my button was
                        doing absolutuely nothing at the time. But I fixed it and it continued to work.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> While this wasn't the easiest of tasks for me, it wasn't as hard as last lab. I think I did just fine, and stuggled the amount
                        I thought I would struggle. Overall I think I did okay on this lab.
                    </p>
