        //Print P1 rock wins
      //If P2 chooses rock and P1 chooses scissors,
        //Print P2 rock wins
      //If P1 player choses rock and P2 choses paper,
        //Print P2 paper wins
      //If P2 player choses rock and P1 chooses paper,
        //Print P1 paper wins
      //If P1 player chooses scissors and P2 chooses paper,
        //Print P1 scissors wins
      //If P2 player chooses scissors and and P1 chooses paper,
        //Print P2 scissors wins 
      //If P1 and P2 choose rock, repeat step 2
