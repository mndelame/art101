			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode and Problem-solving. 4 tasks in which you create a psuedocode for a simple tasks, 
						then psuedocode for a simple computer game, turning the psuedocode into a comments, then creating an index.html for lab 4.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Personally for me, before even starting the lab I think understanding how to even psuedocode something basic, or honestly anything
						was something that was hard for me. Being able to approach a situation while planning it out in various in-depth steps was very interesting to
						do, especially since knowing I would have to then make it into a "coding language" was very intimidating to look at. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab went fairly well. I think I had a lot more struggle with how to describe steps of something, but my partner was very helpful.
						I feel like I had a lot of questions this lab, and thankfully my partner was able to help me out and was patient and showed me what to do when I was lost. 
						We chose "Rock, Paper, Scissors" as our game since it seemed like a simple game, but it did have a lot of possible outcomes, so having to type out the possible
						outcomes of each players hand took a bit of time, but was managable. We were able to fulfill the tasks required of us.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Task 1:
						How to make tea:
							- Take out a tea bag, cup, coffee stick, and kettle.
							- Fill the kettle with water.
							- Turn on kettle until water is boiling. 
							- Place tea bag into the cup.
							- Pour the boiling water into the cup.
							- Wait 3-5 minutes.
								- Add sugar or honey or lemon after the 3-5 minutes if you want.
							- Stir the tea in a circle motion with a coffee stick.
							- Enjoy the tea!
						</p>

						<p>Task 2:
						Creating a rock, paper, scissor game:
							1. Get two players.
							2. Have each player choose either rock, paper, or scissors.
							3. At the same time, each player reveals what object they have chosen.
								If one player chooses rock and the other scissors, rock wins.
								If one player chooses rock and the other paper, paper wins.
								If both players choose rock, repeat step 2.
								If one player chooses scissors and the other paper, scissors wins.
								If both players choose scissors, repeat step 2.
								If both players choose paper, repeat step 2.
							4. End game.
						</p>

						<p> Task 3 & 4
							<pre><code>
Start
    //2 players (player 1 = "P1", player 2 = "P2")
      //prompt users for a choice ("rock", "paper", or "scissors")
      //If P1 choses rock and P2 chooses scissors,
        //Print P1 rock wins
      //If P2 chooses rock and P1 chooses scissors,
        //Print P2 rock wins
      //If P1 player choses rock and P2 choses paper,
        //Print P2 paper wins
      //If P2 player choses rock and P1 chooses paper,
        //Print P1 paper wins
      //If P1 player chooses scissors and P2 chooses paper,
        //Print P1 scissors wins
      //If P2 player chooses scissors and and P1 chooses paper,
        //Print P2 scissors wins 
      //If P1 and P2 choose rock, repeat step 2
        // Print Tie
      //If P1 and P2 choose scissors, repeat step 2
        //Print Tie
      //If P1 and P2 choose paper, repeat step 2
        //Print Tie      
End
