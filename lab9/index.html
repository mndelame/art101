					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had quite some trouble in the js file, especially with writing code as I kept on misspelling items, and happened to not close multiple brackets
                        causing my code not to work. There was a time were I spelled everything correct, but it said it was wrong, though when I asked some of
                        my classmates, they saw it and says it was correct. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I took a while on this lab, and since I started it on the day it was due, I took a lot of my day to figure it out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Was able to follow the tasks with some issues, but finished leading to the product.</p>
