			<h1>Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks - Functions </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some troubles with figuring out how to publish my js to my html file so it was a bit tricky to upload it to my site. This was probably my only yet biggest Problem
                        considering this is the focal point of the task. Though after realizing that it wouldn't load directly onto my page, yet the information was there and correct made,
                    made me realize it wasn't actually a problem/error.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble figuring out how to "link" or add stuff to my pages to make it work on a browser, but I was able to get it working by the end. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Was able to follow the tasks with some issues, but finished leading to the product.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
