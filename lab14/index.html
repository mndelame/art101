					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I didnt have many problems with this lab. If anything it was at first trying to understand what Debugging a past lab assignment would mean.
                        But other than that I didn't have too much trouble with this one.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think I did just fine, and struggled the amount I thought I would struggle.
                        Overall I think I did okay on this lab.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Was able to follow the tasks with minimal issues, but finished leading to the product.</p>
