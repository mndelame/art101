			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Creating a local file structure on our computers, adding index.html files and uploading them to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems I personally had was making sure all the code was correct and that every slash or period was in its right place. Beyond that everything had made sense just, the small things were harder to keep tabs on. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab went fairly well. As the instructions on canvas were helpful to follow along and because it included what exact written code was needed to make sure it would perform the way it was intnded.
						 It also helped that most of the lab was things we had already done or was already done by Wes. Such as the file structure and downloading the things we needed in prior classes/lectures.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Was able to follow along to the lab instructions, addindg a personal image and little description of ourselves in our home page whilst creating a website of what we have created. </p>
