            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p> My name is Madison Grace Noble De La Merced, which is a fairly long name so I instead go by just Madison or Mads. (please no Maddy though)
                     I am a second year here at UCSC and a FDM major or otherwise known as Film and Digital Media major.
                     I'm pretty clueless with these types of things, such as coding and honestly computers in general
                    but I feel like this class will help me learn a lot more than my previous knowledge.
                    My partners name is Shea Line and is from a town called Windsor that's about an hour north from San Francisco.
                    They are a fourth year Computer Science: Game Design major and have a good amount of experience programming. </p>
