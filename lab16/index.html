					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> With this lab, I honestly didn't know where to start, which would be one of my first problems. Though after looking at the work my partner had already done 
                        for his lab, I kinda got the idea of what to do. Some of my issues were the linking of things, as at first my images wouldn't show up, but in the end I Was
                        able to figure it out after messing around with it for a bit.
                    </p>
