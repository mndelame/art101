			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Personally for me, I always had the red scrible-type underline with most of my inputs, making it not valid for the program. 
						Because of this I was struggling a little bit on what I was doing wrong, until I realized that I was missing a "+" in my "document.writeln()" lines.
						After that, I don't think I had many problems beyond. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection/Results</h2>
					<p>I was able to do the lab, especially after going through the overall steps within the lecture, it made it much more easier to understand the directions
						of the task. Below, should be the items/output from the "js" folder.
					</p>
