					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I didnt have many problems with this lab. If anything I had some problems with aking sure I had a correct "script src",
                        but other than that it was mainly just some spelling errors.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think I did just fine, and stuggled the amount I thought I would struggle, which is basically spelling/linking errors.
                        Overall I think I did okay on this lab.
                    </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Was able to follow the tasks with minimal issues, but finished leading to the product.</p>
